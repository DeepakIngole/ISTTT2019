    "This is a guide to recover results presented in *\"A hierarchical approach for splitting truck platoons near network discontinuities\"*. Results are presented in different Notebooks. Which should be able to run independently. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Note***: In order to run notebooks `01-Open-loop.ipynb`, `02-Tactical-strategy.ipynb` , `03-Operational-strategy.ipynb` a Symuvia version is required. Please do not hesitate to contact us in case you need support. You can recover results of the\n",

    "- [01-Open-loop.ipynb](01-Open-loop.ipynb): This notebook details on a platoon formation reaching a merging situation is presented. No controls strategies are proposed for the merge \n",
    "- [02-Tactical-strategy.ipynb](02-Tactical-strategy.ipynb): In order to solve the control problem two phases are presented in the research. This notebook presents computation for the *Tactical* decisions \n",
    "- [03-Operational-strategy.ipynb](03-Operational-strategy.ipynb): In this notebook the deployment  of the control strategy  over the platoon of vehicles is presented. \n",
